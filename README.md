* Still practicing css and responsive design
* I don't know much of react just basic hooks

* Problems Encounter:
1. share state variable among sibling component (happened in Header.jsx)
2. grid sliding display (I don't know if my way is effiecient)
3. handling css files (my initial plan was to create css file for each component but it happens to also affect other's styles when they have the same selector especially className) || solved by modules
